### 🔸 **Helpful Rules for Choosing the Right Form**

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
   - He/She/It → Verb + **s/es** (plays, goes)
   - I/You/We/They → Verb without **s** (play, go)

2. **Use V3 with:**
   - **Have, has, had, been** (done, gone, taken)

3. **Use V-ing with:**
   - **am/is/are, was/were, be (progressive form)**

4. **After modal verbs (can, must, should):**
   - Use **base form (V1)**  
   > Example: You **should go**, not "should goes"
